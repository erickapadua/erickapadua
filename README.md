### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ericka, I recently completed masters in Political Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland & Labrador. I was a Graduate Assistant at Nexus Research Centre, Managing Editor of the Population & Security Website and the current President of Women in CyberSecurity, MUNL Chapter.Â  
 
I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Communication, cum laude, from Angeles University Foundation in the Philippines. After graduation, I worked as a news correspondent, multimedia director, and radio host before moving to South Korea in November 2015 to work for the Overseas Business Division of an automotive company. 

Throughout my academic journey at MUNL, while engaging in my research on Filipino migrants' remittances, I developed an interest in Cybersecurity. This interest was sparked by the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks in today's digital landscape. My newfound passion has driven me to take the initiative in establishing the WiCyS chapter at MUNL.
