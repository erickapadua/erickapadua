### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ericka, an MA student in Political Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland & Labrador, Graduate Assistant at Nexus Research Centre, Page at Newfoundland House of Assembly and the current President of Women in CyberSecurity, MUNL Chapter.Â  

Ericka earned her Bachelor of Arts in Communication, cum laude, from Angeles University Foundation in the Philippines. After graduation, she worked as a news correspondent, multimedia director, and radio host before moving to South Korea in November 2015 to work for Overseas Business Division for an automotive company. 

Throughout her academic journey at MUNL, while engaging in her research on Filipino migrants' remittances, Ericka developed an interest in Cybersecurity. This interest was sparked by the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks in today's digital landscape. Her newfound passion has driven her to take the initiative in establishing the WiCyS chapter at MUNL.
